// Universal Links (tapping a linkedout.app link opens the app directly,
// no browser interstitial). REPLACE THE PLACEHOLDERS before this does
// anything: "TEAMID" is your Apple Developer Team ID (Apple Developer
// portal → Membership), and the bundle id must match app.json's
// ios.bundleIdentifier in linkedout-native. Until both are real, iOS
// will simply fail verification silently and links keep opening in
// Safari instead — that fallback is harmless, not a crash.
