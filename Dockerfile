# Docker sets a HOSTNAME env var to the container's own ID by default, and
# Next.js's standalone server reads that to decide which interface to bind
# to — so without this, it binds to something like "a1b2c3d4e5f6:3000"
# instead of all interfaces, which is unreachable from outside the
# container (this exact symptom: the process logs "Ready" successfully,
# but every request from a reverse proxy in front of it gets a 502/refused
# connection). Forcing HOSTNAME=0.0.0.0 here, via `exec env`, overrides
# whatever the platform's container runtime sets, so this holds regardless
# of which host (Railway, Fly, plain Docker, etc.) runs the image.
