// calls — and every post/company/job/room is created through the exact
// same await createPost()/await createCompany()/await createJob()/await createRoom() functions
// the real API routes call. Nothing here is a fake row injected directly
// into a table; it's the same code path a real signup + real posting
// session would take, run 20-some times in a row.
//
// This is the pattern documented in-chat earlier: Reddit's founders

// ---------------- Timestamp dispersion ----------------
// Every createXxx() call defaults to "now" if you don't pass createdAt —
// fine for real usage, but calling all of them back-to-back in this
// script used to leave every seeded post within seconds of each other.
// Worse than that: even the earlier version of this fix (random jitter
// spread across weeks) could still land two posts in the same relative-
// time *bucket* — formatRelativeTime() in lib/content/db.js rounds down
// to "Nh ago" / "Nd ago" / "Nw ago", so two posts nine minutes apart can
// both read "3h ago". That's the actual tell that gives away a cold
// start, not the raw timestamps. Fixed properly below: each cursor hands
// out a shuffled-free, strictly distinct sequence of bucket values (1h
// ago, 2h ago, 3h ago... never repeating one), weighted toward recent
// activity the way a real feed's history actually looks — a long tail
// of a few older posts, a cluster of very recent ones — rather than an
// unnaturally even smear across the whole window. Because
// formatRelativeTime() recomputes from the stored created_at against
// Date.now() on every read, labels keep advancing correctly in
// real time after deploy on their own — nothing to maintain there, and
// nothing about re-running this script later "resets" that; it just
// adds a fresh, equally-distinct batch of its own.
